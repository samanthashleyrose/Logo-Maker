### ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS FROM UCONN'S CODING BOOTCAMP

### Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker
Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG fileLinks to an external site.. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the Video Submission GuideLinks to an external site. on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.

**User Story** <br>
`AS a freelance web developer`<br>
`I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects`<br>
`SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer`<br>

**Acceptance Criteria**<br>
`GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input`<br>
`WHEN I am prompted for text`<br>
`THEN I can enter up to three characters`<br>
`WHEN I am prompted for the text color`<br>
`THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)`<br>
`WHEN I am prompted for a shape`<br>
`THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square`<br>
`WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color`<br>
`THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)`<br>
`WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts`<br>
`THEN an SVG file is created named logo.svg`<br>
`AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line`<br>
`WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser`<br>
